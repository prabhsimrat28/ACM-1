<h1>About</h1>
<p>This website is made by Prabhsimrat Singh(COPC) with a little bit knowledge of HTML and CSS . I have tried my best to design this website . It took me 2 hours to create it . This website is designed without any use of Chat-GPT or any other AI Tool . Talking of my hobbies I enjoy hip-hop music , hanging out with friends , play cricket and cards , make rovers and sometimes coding for fun...</p>
<p>I hope that soon I will be able to re-design this website in a better way as I learn Java-Sript and get better in CSS. I believe in hard-work , teamwork , being truthful to myself and learning from my mistakes . </p>
